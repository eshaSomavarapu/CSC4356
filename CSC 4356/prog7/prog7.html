        <p><strong>Objective</strong></p>
            <p>Implement a field of grass with a light sources moving across the grass along X, Y, Z axes.</p>
            <p>Goal of the project was have an image similar to: http://i.imgur.com/1MDNZtY.jpg</p>
        <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
            <p>For this project, I decided to implement a field of grass that also has a light source that moves
               along X, Y, Z axes. This allowed for creation of my own 3-D model using a modeling software. Therefore, I
               have used blender, which supports 3D objects modeling. I have based this project on the concept learned in
               the course is texture mapping has the ability to give each fragment a different color. We know that texture
               coordinates range from 0 to 1. Since the texture of of model unwrapped should fit within a square. All we
               have to do is assign each vertex a texture coordinate to the location within the square. This enables
               communication between vertex shader and fragment shader through this varying attribute.
           </p>
        <p><strong>Blender</strong></p>
            <p>As I mentioned earlier, I chose the approach to use a modeling software was to give better grasp on
               modeling 3D images. This project enabled me to get a deeper understanding of constructing my own model
               and as well as figuring out problems and conducting research on exporting the right file so you can
               have it in the format that was necessary. Initially experimenting with blender,
               I had a lot of trouble starting out because I was unable to find a good tutorial that was easy to follow
               and that would go in-depth about the tools that allowed for creation of grass.
               At last, after spending hours of bad tutorials on YouTube, I found one video that explained things in a
               better fashion than other videos. I used this YouTube video to ultimately create my model which is a field
               of grass.
           </p>
           <p>Model Developed in blender:&nbsp;http://i.imgur.com/hSIbxhL.jpg</p>
        <p><strong>Converting Files</strong></p>
            <p>By reading the stack exchange, I figured out that there was a way to export blender files to Wave front (.obj)
               which produced a .obj file. Later, when I was sifting the website about the final project. I came across a
               link under tools called jsobj. Then, I found a solution to converting my .obj file of grass into
               JSON files which organized and converted the contents of my .obj file into similar files given previously
               by Dr. Kooima, which contains arrays for normals, positions, texture coordinates, tangents, and triangles.
           </p>
        <p><strong>Implementation</strong></p>
            <p>I started off this project by using my older implementation of project 6,
               which uses lighting across different plane like X,Y,Z, and texture mapping to a chest.
               However, for this project, we need a creation of my own model and texture.
           </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>There are two main things that are required for this project:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>grass.js: This file actually contains the model built in blender. It has tables of data that c
                    ontain, vertex normals, vertex positions, triangle indices and texture coordinates.&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>Grass Texture-01.png: This file actually contains the texture I created in Photoshop that would
                    wrap around the model.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Initialization:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Get texture coordinates</li>
                <li>Create model texture</li>
                <li>Load the Texture using model Image, and model texture</li>
                <li>Set the source of model image</li>
                <li>Bind the texture to null</li>
                <li>Enable Depth test</li>
                <li>Request a animation frame</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Rendering:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create your matrixes for perspective, view and model transformations</li>
                <li>At render time, clear the depth buffer along with the color buffer</li>
                <li>Calling the slider function by defining the light position across X, Y, Z axes.</li>
                <li>Call the lighting shader with use and use defined parameters when rendering</li>
                <li>Draw the grass model using the lighting shader</li>
            </ul>
        <p><strong>Errors Encountered</strong></p>
            <p>Cross Origin Request: When I gave a link to texture image, the browser through an error because that host
               did not support cross-organ resource requests. Later, I hosted my texture on imgur locally and surpassed
               this error.
           </p>
            <p>Texture bound to texture unit 0 is not renderable. It maybe non-power-of-2 and have incompatible texture
               filtering: &nbsp;After reading the stack overflow article on a similar error another user encountered.
               The solution which involved calls to bind the texture and draw elements in the onload function. After,
               trying this solution within my implementation. I was unable to make it work. While debugging, the load
               texture function stopped executing at draw elements. Therefore, after putting it back in model prototype
               function. I executed the program, which returns the same error again.
           </p>
            <p>Finally, the chrome debugger stopped throwing any errors for debugging. Therefore, I started with my
               init and draw functions set break points at the end of the function to see if it was passing everything
               correctly. It went through both of these functions. But, I was unable to detect where the program was
               going wrong since it passed all parameters with any being undefined. I used chest.js from project 5 to get
               a better understanding of my project&rsquo;s errors. When I ran the program, a black and grey chest showed
               up. Therefore, my program was unable to map the texture onto the model. Since, the debugger also didn&rsquo;t
               provide any errors in the console made debugging very hard for this project.&nbsp;&nbsp;
           </p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
            <p>After implementing my project, I couldn&rsquo;t overcome my errors even though I had a good base for this
               project which was working project 5. Also, it was hard to find a references or white paper articles or
               tutorials explaining the implementation of field of grass. I applied what I learned over the course of the
               semester within this project. I am glad I learnt a lot throughout the semester which implement this project,
                even if it there&rsquo;s no output.
            </p>
            <p>Working on this project gave me a lot of experience with debugging, model creation, texture creation and use
               of light sources along different axes such as X, Y, Z. It also allowed me to map different texture to a
               new model. This project served as a great learning experience because I would love to take it further over
               break to learn and reflect on my mistakes within this project.&nbsp;
